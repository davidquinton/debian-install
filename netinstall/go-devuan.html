I run Debian Jessie without systemd, just because I don't need to go that way - sysvinit boots my system just fine.  But it was getting increasingly difficult to install some packages because they depended on systemd, and I needed to install bluefish.  This cool html editor however, is dependent on gvfs-backends which depends on libpam-systemd, which depends on the big one, systemd.
<br><br>
Enter Devuan.  It looks like they've come a long way developing their Debian fork.  They fork anything that depends on systemd to remove the dependency and mirror anything else from the debian repositories - quite a job to be doing.
<br><br>
To migrate to Devuan, at the moment you just need to change your package sources, update, and upgrade and that's all.
<br><br>
<div class="bullet"><ul><li>backup the debian sources.list file</li></div>
<form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="80">
sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list-debian</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>


<div class="bullet"><ul><li>Download <span class="inst">devuan-baseconf</span> from their site <a href="http://packages.devuan.org/">http://packages.devuan.org/</a></li>

<li>Then install it with dpkg -i ... </li>

<li>enter "jessie" as Devuan suite when asked as it's of course the easiest to migrate to from Jessie (or wheezy)</li>

<li>Hit enter with "main"</li>

<li>install the devuan keyring and run an upgrade</li></div>
<br>
<textarea name="T" id="install" rows="3" cols="50">
su
apt-get update && apt-get install devuan-keyring
aptitude full-upgrade </textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>
<br><br><br>
(this upgraded 35 packages and retrieved 4Mb - for a recently updated Jessie install)
<br><br>
Now go ahead and install bluefish or whatever, without any systemd dependency issues!
