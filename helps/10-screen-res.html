I've never needed to find out about setting the screen resolution, as I seem to always be installing Debian on laptops. But just now I installed on a desktop PC and the screen resolution was somewhat stuck on a low setting with no options in Preferences &gt; Monitor Settings to set 1920x1080 pix. 
<br><br><br>

So, whether its a propriety driver or its the kernel's driver that isn't detecting the monitor's capabilities, we might need to add a config file to tell the system what res to turn on the screen with.
<br><br><br>

What we need to do is edit the "Monitor" and "Screen" sections of xorg.conf - and I read that if that file is not around (in /etc/X11 - and its not there any more by default as X loads up device settings as it sees them during boot) it can be generated with,
<br>
<form><textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="2" cols="30">
cd /etc/X11
X11 -configure</textarea>
<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>
<br>
or exit Openbox (ie stop any display manager running X) and run<br>
<form><textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="30">
X :1 -configure</textarea>
<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>
<br>


But I only got an error and no file made.
<br><br><br>

The next option is to create a file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ with just the Sections that we want Xorg to make the settings for,


<form><textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="2" cols="80">
sudo mkdir/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf</textarea>
<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>

<br>

For my resolution requirement I put these lines in the file:

<form><textarea name="T" id="file" rows="18" cols="100">
Section "Monitor"
  Identifier  "Monitor0"
  HorizSync  30.0 - 86.0
  VertRefresh 56.0 - 76.0
  Modeline   "1920x1080" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
  Option  "PreferredMode" "1920x1080"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
  Identifier "Screen0"
  Device   "Device0"
  Monitor  "Monitor0"

  SubSection "Display"
   Depth   24
   Modes  "1920x1080"
  EndSubSection
EndSection</textarea>
<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>
<br>
<br>

you can add modelines to Monitor section and modes to Screen section, as you need.
<br><br>

You get the modeline by this command

<form><textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="80">
cvt 1920 1080 60</textarea>
<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>
<br>

ie, `cvt &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt; &lt;refresh-rate&gt;`
<br><br>
<br>

If you are using a specific graphics card, then that might need adding too, with

<form><textarea name="T" id="file" rows="4" cols="80">
Section "Device"
  Identifier  "Device0"
  Driver    "driver-name" #Choose the driver used for this monitor
EndSection</textarea>
<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>

<br><br>

Detailed manual is here<a href="http://www.x.org/archive/current/doc/man/man5/xorg.conf.5.xhtml">www.x.org/archive/...</a>
<br><br><br>


A second monitor will need its own entries, and Monitor0, Screen0 and Device0 will change to Monitor1, Screen1 and Device1.<br>
