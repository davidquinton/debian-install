Here's a very handy application using a sleek webkit interface, that can cut up practically any video codec and merge it into a new file without re-encoding.<br>
Get it here

<br><br>
<b>A few things to remember...</b><br>
<div class="bullet"><ul>
<li>cuts (coloured areas) will be saved, the blank areas will be lost
<li>if you intend to cut out small parts, eg. to make improvements to a film, you will need to set the first cut start point at the very beginning of the movie clip, and its end point at the first part to cut out
</ul>
<br><br>

<h3><h3>Usage</h3></h3>
<ul><li>bottom <span class="bblue">< </span>and <span class="bblue"> > </span>to set cut start/end
<li><span class="bblue">c+</span> - set each additional cut (it will auto-set the cut start point)
<li><span class="bblue">nm/am</span> - set auto merge or no merge of cuts
<li>click in a cut area to enable reposition of start/end
<li>click on cut number to remove it
<li><span class="bblue">scissors</span> to save the cuts to file (default same dir as source)
<li><span class="bblue">cd</span> - change save dir
</ul>
<br><br>
to append movies, use Tools > merge, then load the merged file to make cuts
<br><br>
conversion is very simple, with no options
<br><br>
ideal if it had two modes, <br>
1. save cuts (movie content grab)<br>
2. remove cuts (glitch chop out)
<br><br>

why a trash button? its very close to the cut buttons
