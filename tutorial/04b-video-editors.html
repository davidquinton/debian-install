<div class="cont">

Here's my round up of the main video editors for Linux, their pros and cons, and how they scored with me. <br>
I tested them all in Sept 2017 but haven't used any of them since then except for Cinelerra (which is why it's streaming ahead!)

<br><br>
See my Netinstall Step2 page for how to install most of them.
