<li>extensive themes/colours

<li>easy to adjust project settings such as dimensions and frame rate on-the-fly via properties window
<li>adjustable clip properties available at right
<li>media opens straight onto the sequencer
<li>dragging strips over another snaps the strip to the end, meaning precise positioning
<li>precise application of effects using keyframes and graph editor
<li>meta strips used to apply effects without touching the original strips
<li>strips can be grouped, grabbed, or locked in place
<li>frame range decides how much of the movie to render
<li>total render control, full format options (only missing webm)
<li>program has a lot more potential than video editing (3D animation)
<li>can run renders from the commandline
<li>can run multiple blender processes -render one project while working on a new one
<li>compact and detailed workspace
<li>opens up fast and is very stable</td>


<td valign="top"><ul><li>audio/video strips automatically split on import to the sequencer and must be both selected to make edits
<li>no snapping by single key, must select strip ends then snap (select time-linked strips, highlight handles, snap handles, remove gaps =4 actions) 
<li>can't set frame range to max strip extent automatically, must always set start and end manually
<li>can't create custom render presets
<li>limited to single thread cpu rendering, shared between cpu cores (slow) -2
<li>not a program for movie editing beginners -ui is perhaps more confusing</td></tr>
