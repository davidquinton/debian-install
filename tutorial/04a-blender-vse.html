Blender can look quite confusing for the first time, especially as it has so many functions in its main role of producing 3D animations. Its Sequence Editor has a slightly different approach to making movies than other editors and it's a very good idea to spend time with the video tutorials online first, so that things become obvious.

<h2 id="1" class="tag">What's different</h2>

<div class="bullet"><ul>

Here are some main differences of Blender VSE to other non-linear video editors for Linux..
<br><br>

<li>video-audio is immediately split into "strips" when added, therefore moving a strip means that you must select both video + audio atthe same time, also for cutting at the same frame</li>

<li>no overlapping mode - when strips are overlapped the overlapping one highlights red, then on placing it it jumps to the end of the underlying strip - handy for placing strips exactly at end of others.</li>
<br>
- means that vid/audio strips need to be cut at whatever frame should be first/last, then pressing Backspace will close the gap between the cut frame and the preceding/next stip.
<br><br>
- the idea is that each strip should to be worked on by itself, not by another strip overlapping it to decide what its last frame should be.
<br><br>

<li>selection is done by RMB, seek is by LMB on the sequence editor.</li>

<li>the render does not assume that the total length of strips is the total length of the project to be made - rendering uses the frame range for length of output movie.</li>
</ul>

<br><br><br>

<h2 id="2" class="tag">My Tips</h2>
<br><br>
<h3>Window arrangement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open Blender and select Video Editing layout from first drop-down at top.
<li>drag the preview from right over to the left and make the new far right window a Properties.
<li>make the left window Graph if you like.
<li>under File, Save Startup File - so that reopening Blender it will be ready for video editing.
</ul>

<br><br>
<h3>Theme</h3>
<ul>
<li>open User Preferences in the left window
<li>Themes tab
<li>choose a preset - I selected Ubuntu and adjusted the graph and sequencer backgrounds a little lighter
</ul>

<br><br>
<h3>Set Spacebar to play/pause animation..</h3>
<ul>
<li>open User Preferences in one window (select from type icon)
<li>go to Input tab and expand Sequencer and Frame
<li>click on Add New then expand it and paste "screen.animation_play" to the first box (which reads "none")
<li>click on the second box twice and press <b>Spacebar</b>
<li>make one for both Sequencer and Frame for the shortcut to be active when the mouse hovers these windows (including the preview window) 
its set to play!<br>
(this will stop Space from bringing up shortcut search!)
<li>Click Save User Settings too.
</ul>


<br><br>
<h3>Adding video strips</h3>
<ul>
<li>click on Add > Movie
<li>select files (hold Shift for multiple)
<li>once the strips are on the sequencer, check that the no. of frames for audio = no. frames for video - if audio shows more, go to the project properties and adjust the <b>Frame rate </b>to the correct value, e.g. 24, 25, 29.97 etc - so that the audio and video match up for frames. 
<li>if the video looks squashed or stretched, RMB on the video strip and go to <b>Strip</b> (below) <b>> Render size</b> to set the strip's dimensions to the properties window - as your saved properties may be set to 1080p resolution and the video you're working with is different.
<li>if it still looks skewiff after that, go to the properties and adjust the <b>Aspect Ratio</b> to correct value (sometimes needs 1:1)
</ul>

<br><br><br>
<h3>Zooming in on the Sequencer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Press <b>Shift-B</b> and drag a box with LMB to select an area to zoom in on
<li>press <b>Home</b> to zoom out to see the whole length of strips
</ul>

<br><br><br>
<h3>Using the Timeline</h3>
<ul>
<li>if you are zoomed in quite close in the Sequencer, you can move to other places on it quite easily by clicking in the Timeline, below the Sequencer (you might need to pull it up to see it, and you may have to zoom out)
<li>pressing Home while hovering the Timeline will zoom to the Frame range you have set, mouse scroll to zoom out/in
<li>unfortunately, the Timeline doesn't show what positions the strips are placed on, or how much space they use, but it does show markers, so adding markers along the way would be useful
</ul>
<br><br><br>

<h3>Markers</h3>
<ul>
<li>place a marker with <b>M</b>, RMB select one and <b>X</b> to remove it.
<li>set hotkeys for Jump to previous/ Jump to next marker - RC on the menu item and select Add Shortcut, then type your shortcut, e.g <b>Shift-,</b> and <b>Shift-.</b> (in effect < and >)
</ul>

<br><br><br>
<h3>Preview Range </h3>
<ul>
<li>Press <b>P </b>and drag an area to set the preview range - play will run through this area over and over, no stopping. That means you can keep playing a particular edit/effect, while you make adjustments to the effects to see the changes live.
<li><b>Alt-P</b> to clear the range.
</ul>

<br><br><br>
<h3>Selecting strips to move them about</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>RMB</b> on the middle of a strip to select it, <b>Shift-RMB</b> to select others, or press <b>B</b> and drag a box with LMB to select all in the box (note that you should RMB without Shift on the first strip to cancel any previous selection and so as not add to the previous selected strips and later cause trouble)
<li>you can press <b>A</b> to toggle select all
<li>press <b>G</b> to grab them
<li>they will now follow the mouse - <b>LMB</b> to place them, or <b>RMB</b> again to cancel the grab.
<li>if you press the <b>Shift</b> key while moving the strip it will move much more minutely, in order to be more accurate.
</ul>
<br>
you can't overlap strips, they will jump out to find space on the end.

<br>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Delete strips</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>RMB</b> select strips and hit <b>X</b> or <b>Delete</b>, then confirm
<li><b>Ctrl-Z</b> will also undo the action</ul>

<br><br><br>
<h3>Snapping strips</h3>
<br>
Shift-S snaps a selected strip to the seek point, or the end of a strip (stretches it out)
<br><br>
So, to move the start/end frame to the seek point (ie make a soft cut while removing the cut off part from the sequencer) ..
<br>
<ul>
<li>seek to the cut point
<li>RMB on the end of the strip you want to shrink down
<li><b>Shift-S</b> to shrink the strip to the seek point
</ul>

<br><br>
and if its the first strip in the sequence, and you remove some of the start frames, you will need to move to the new start frame with PgUp and use Frame > Set Start Frame (as there's no gap to remove)
<br><br>
if its a strip somewhere along the sequence the cut will make a gap - click LMB in the gap and use <b>Backspace</b> to close the gap.
<br><br>
If you press <b>S</b> (Slip Strip) you can then drag the content of the strip that you cut within its new frame length, in case you wanted to.
(worth changing round <b>S</b> and <b>Shift-S</b>)
<br><br>
If you select the ends of a strip and press <b>G </b>to grab them you can extend them out, but if the strip then overlaps another strip and you place it with LMB, then the strip you extended will jump out to the end of the sequence to find enough space forewith that it might sit.  It will not overlap or push out the strips it overlapped.
<br><br>
To get round that you need to insert gaps at the strip end with <b>Shift-=</b>, as much as you think you need to extend the strip ends.
<br><br><br>





<br><br>
<h3>Fade out/ fade in</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select the point to start the fade out to black.
<li>in the properties to the right (press <b>N</b>) make sure Opacity is 1.0, RC and <b>Insert Keyframe</b>
<li>move seek point to the end of the clip, click on the Opacity and set to 0, then RC and <b>Insert Keyframe</b>
<li>Blender will make a smooth transition from one setting to the other between the keyframes, which you can see in the Graph (press Home to show full).
<li>0 opacity will be showing the base colour which should be black, unless other strips are under the strip on another channel.
</ul>

<br>
You don't need to make a black colour strip and gamma cross effect (as the tutorials teach).
<br><br><br>

<h2 id="3" class="tag">Multi-threading the render process</h2>

Man! Blender will not render on all threads together, it switches threads, using only 25% cpu power - thus renders take much longer than they should do and modern processing speed is not utilised.
<br><br>
Here's the answer (for now).. <b>Pulverize</b>
<br><br>
copy these scripts made by Hunter Perrin, from <a href="https://github.com/sciactive/pulverize">github.com/sciactive..</a>
<br><br>
<i>pulverize.php<br>
pulverize_tools.py</i>
<br><br>
(pulverize.py is also there but it doesn't show progress)
<br><br>
put them in your scripts dir or symlink to them in /usr/bin
<br><br>

then install php with,
<form>
<textarea name="T" id="install" rows="1" cols="30">
sudo apt-get install php7.0</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>

<br><br>

save your blender output to a dir, no file name.
<br><br>


cd projects/blender/<br>
pulverize.php &#60;blender_project_file> [&#60;number_of_processes>] [&#60;options>]
<br><br>
e.g.
<form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="80">
pulverize.php project.blend 4 '{\"displayStdErr\":true}'</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>


<br>
if you state too many threads, it will default to half of real no. threads.

<br><br>


For the portable app, not installed with package manager, need to symlink the app in /usr...
<br><br>
ln -s path/to/your/blenderdir/blender /usr/bin/blender
<br><br><br><br>
