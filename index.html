<h3>Wanting install a fast, low-memory consuming Linux system on your box?  just read on...</h3>  
<br><br>

Debian GNU Linux is an OS that works 100% of the time, is fast, stable and powerful... Made by developers from around the world who contribute their skills and at the same time keep it free for every one, it's is so well developed that several popular 'distros' (iincluding Ubuntu and Mint and the like) are built on it.  But since 2016, Debian voted to switch to the start-up daemon called systemd and practically left no choice on the matter (which opens the controversy about systemd as Debian is meant to be about freedom of choice) and the old 'init' start-up scripts that were easy to customise were scrapped.  The new daemon is also extremely difficult to learn and there are too many parts of the system and other programs that depend on it so it's not simply a case of leaving it out if unwanted.  Trying to run Debian on the old sysinit is now nigh impossible.  


<br><br>
As soon as I found systemd running after upgrading to Debian Jessie I searched for a way to be free of it, as the reason I chose Debian was to be free of lock-ins.  So I came to <b>Devuan</b>, a Debian branch that keeps systemd out of everything.  Sysinit is able to operate like before and any system or software package that needs systemd is repackaged in order to exclude it.  All other packages are simply mirrored from the Debian software repositories. Release code names are different to Debian and it is not possible (since Jessie) to dist-upgrade from Debian to it.
<br><br>
So on these pages are the steps I take to get Devuan installed and configured, but in actual fact there's hardly anything different than installing Debian.  The only differences are: lines in sources file, systemd negative pinning, and location of ISO downloads for install of a complete working desktop in one go.
<br><br>
With Debian/Devuan the days of a hanging system chewing on memory are gone. ...it's time to format those Windoze partitions!  
<br><br>

<b>...</b>
My install steps begin on the next page, getting started by downloading a Netinstall CD or Live CD from the web..
<br><br>
The <b>Net-install CD</b> gives you the base system. After that, you can install whatever else that you need from the 1000's of packages in the Debian repository, using a few simple commands.  I've kept my package list pretty minimal, and I'm conscious of choosing low-memory consuming apps where possible. 
<br><br>
If you're really new to Linux you could get Debian running quite easily by using a <b>Debian live CD </b>with a full Desktop Environment included (though it will be a much bigger download).
