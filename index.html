<h3>Wanting install a fast, low-memory consuming Linux system on your box?  just read on...</h3>  
<br><br>

Debian GNU Linux is an OS that works 100% of the time (just about), and is fast, stable and powerful... and Free! It's so well made that some popular Linux 'distros' are built on it such as Ubuntu and Mint.  Debian has a choice of 'Live CD's and such that you can just run or install, but I much prefer building it myself from the base upm and that's what these notes are to help with.
<br><br>

There's also a branch called Devuan, which I now use.
<br><br>

So here are the steps necessary to get Devuan installed and configured, which is practically no different to installing Debian.  The only differences are: lines in packages sources file, systemd negative pinning, and location of the ISO downloads.
<br><br>
With Debian/Devuan the days of a hanging system chewing on memory are gone. ...it's time to format those Windoze partitions!  
<br><br>

On the next page, getting started by downloading a Netinstall CD or Live CD from the web...
<br><br>
The <b>Net-install CD</b> gives you the base system. After that, you can install whatever else that you need from the 1000's of packages in the Debian repository, using a few simple commands.  I've kept my package lists pretty minimal, and I'm conscious of choosing low-memory consuming apps where possible and avoiding massive bloat of libraries (for example I stay away from KDE and gnome).   This is the fun way to install, building the desktop how you would prefer it, but you do need a lot more time to get it running and also some command-line ability.  You'll also need to look on-line for answers if you run into any problems.
<br><br>
If you're really new to Linux you could get a Debian/Devuan system running quite easily by using a <b>Live CD </b>with a full Desktop Environment included (though it will be a much bigger download).
