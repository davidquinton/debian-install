<h3>Here we go, my notes are now up on Github pages after a complete re-write.</h3>  
<br><br>

Here's how to install Debian GNU Linux! an OS that works 100% of the time, is fast, stable, customisable, powerful... on these pages is every step I take to get a nice Debian system installed, configured, running, and how to fix things when needed.
<br><br>
Debian is <b>Linux</b>, which means it's free, and not sucking from your pocket like other OS's around.. its open-source which means people everywhere contribute and also it's possibly the most well tested and supported Linux 'distro' there is.... The community is large and help is never far away.  
<br><br>
You may already know of Ubuntu, or the likes (Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Mint). But the distro comes with added bloat and a locked down system. It is actually built on Debian! so why not build your own Debian system and keep it light-weight and simple, and fast?  Nothing too fancy or glittery, but just operable, smooth, productive. 
<br><br>
Quite honestly, with Debian, the days of a hanging system are gone. ...it's time to format those Windoze partitions!  
<br><br>

<br>
<b>...</b>
My install steps begin on the next page, getting started by downloading a Netinstall CD or Live CD from the web..
<br><br>
The <b>Debian Net-install CD</b> gives you the base system, retrieving some of it from the internet. After that, you can install whatever else that you need from the 1000's of packages in the Debian repository, using a few simple commands.  I've kept my package list pretty minimal, and I'm conscious of choosing low-memory consuming apps where possible. 
<br><br>
If you're really new to Linux you could get Debian running quite easily by using a <b>Debian live CD </b>with a full Desktop Environment included (though it will be a much bigger download).
