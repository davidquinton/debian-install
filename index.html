<h3>Here we go, my notes are now up on Github pages after a complete re-write.</h3>  
<br><br>

Looking for an OS to install that works about 100% all the time, is fast, customisable, and stable..? then here's Debian's GNU/Linux.  Being <b>Linux</b> means it's free and it's powerful... being <b>Debian</b> means it's tested and supported...  it's a very nice OS to get on you PC. Time to format those Windoze partitions! Gone are the days of a hanging system!  You can use these notes I made to get a good install of Debian made in just a few hours with a good internet connection. 
<br><br>
I started off with Xubuntu (the XFCE version of Ubuntu, a Debian-based Linux distro with lots of GUI extras and automatics) but soon switched over to Debian so that I could keep things lean and fast.  It was Xfce at first, because it's lighter on memory than others, and after that it was LXDE for quite a while, which is even lighter.  Now I've left that one (but I still install it for others) and just use Openbox window manager alone. 
<br><br>
So why light? My principle is that I might need to run my system on an old or slow machine sometime, and besides that I need free mem available for more demanding tasks, like encoding HD video. 
<br><br>
On my Netinstall pages are the steps I take to get Debian up and running using the <b>Debian Net-install CD</b>, which gets the base system installed, retrieving the bulk of it from over the internet. After that, in Steps 2, 3 and 4, I install all the rest that I need.  I've kept it pretty minimal, and I'm conscious of choosing low-memory consuming apps where possible. 
<br><br>
If however, you are totally new to Linux, or don't feel like following the Netinstall CD method, you can easily get Debian running by using a <b>Debian live CD </b>with a full Desktop Environment included.  There are links to Live CD's on my Netinstall page.  
<br><br>
I hope you'll enjoy Debian - and appreciate too the developers who make it happen!
