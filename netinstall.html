Here's my guide to installing a light-weight, fully functioning Debian system on your box.  You'll have Debian up and running after Step 1, and then Steps 2, 3 and 4 will help you get other important software installed and ready.  After that you can move on to the configuration part.
<br><br>
There's a page to help get Debian installed even faster, with the LXDE flavour, which condenses/summarises the install steps for those who don't need so much explaination.
<br><br>
Then there's details about keeping Debian updated and upgrading to a newer release and how to migrate to Devuan.
